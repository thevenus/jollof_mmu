Inputs without external driver/transition

The following primary inputs have no external driver or input transition set.   
As a result the transition on the ports will be assumed as zero. The            
'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.

Outputs without external load

The following primary outputs have no external load set. As a result the load   
on the ports will be assumed as zero. The 'external_pin_cap' attribute is used  
to add and external pin cap.
