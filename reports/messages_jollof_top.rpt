  3   Info  GLO-12     Replacing a flip-flop with a logic constant 0.     
                       To prevent this optimization, set the              
                       'optimize_constant_0_flops' root attribute to      
                       'false' or 'optimize_constant_0_seq' instance

                       primary outputs.                                   
                       Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                       redundancy removal could change the connections    
                       so an instance does not drive any primary outputs  
                       anymore. To see the list of deleted sequential,    
                       set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or      
                       above. If message is truncated set message         
                       attribute 'truncate' to false to see the complete  
                       list.

                       redundancy removal could change the connections    
                       so a hierarchical instance does not drive any      
                       primary outputs anymore. To see the list of        
                       deleted hierarchical instances, set the            
                       'information_level' attribute to 2 or above. If    
                       message is truncated set message attribute         
                       'truncate' to false to see the complete list. To   
                       prevent this optimization, set the                 
                       'delete_unloaded_insts' root/subdesign attribute   
                       to 'false' or 'preserve' instance attribute to

  3   Info  GLO-45     Replacing the synchronous part of an always        
                       feeding back flip-flop with a logic constant.      
                       The instance attribute                             
                       'optimize_constant_feedback_seq' controls this     
                       optimization. The value used to replace the flop   
                       can be set by the root attribute                   
                       'optimize_seq_x_to'. The assigned constant might   
                       conflict with the simulation and/or verification   
                       setup.

                       1.0, 1.0).
