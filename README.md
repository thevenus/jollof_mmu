# Jollof Matrix Multiplication Unit
## 4x8 Matrix Multiplication Acccelerator ASIC
This repository contains the project files for the ETIN35 - IC Project 1 course. We designed a 4x8 matrix multiplier ASIC starting from the algorithmic description ending with the actual ASIC PnR. The design utilizes only 2 multipliers for area efficiency and is implemented in VHDL93. Simulation is done with QuestaSim, synthesis with Genus, and PnR with Innovus.
